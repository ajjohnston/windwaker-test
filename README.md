# Wind Waker WebGL Test

You can reach the demo [here](https://ajjohnston.github.io/windwaker-test/public/).

After reading a great [article](https://medium.com/@gordonnl/wind-waker-graphics-analysis-a0b575a31127#.jp00zgke2) about the way the ocean in the Wind Waker was designed through various GLSL shaders, I wanted to teach myself how to implement these shaders with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) myself.
